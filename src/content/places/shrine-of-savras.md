# Shrine of Savras

A ruined temple in the remains of the town of **Coneyberry**, once devoted to **Savras**, the god of Divination and Fate. The building was home to a band of were-rats until refugee orcs fleeing the rein of the **Blue Hand Orcs** took it over. They staged raids out of the shrine, until we came to stop them.

We allowed **Soding**, an orc woman, **Butar**, her ogre husband, along with their halfbreed child to leave in peace after it was clear they were not part of the pillaging.

The shrine contains a giant gold bell, which we were unable to recover -- but will be back for in the future.
