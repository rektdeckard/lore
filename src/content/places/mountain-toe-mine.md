# Mountain Tow Mine

A gold mine in the **Sword Mountains**, owned and operated by **Don Jon Raskin** out of **Phandalin**. This is one of the economic centers for the city, and when communication between the two grew silent, the town began to fear for their safety. **Halia Thornton** sent us to check on them, and we found that things had fallen into chaos.

A band of were-rats, displaced from their home in the abandoned shrine outside of **Coneyberry** by the dragon **Ieva**, has come to find themselves here. They took the mine by force, killing several of the dwarven miners. The few that were able to escape were gruesomely executed by the dragon who was apparently in pursuit of the were-rats.

We negotiated a truce with the beasts, and they released the remaining dwarven hostages in exchange for our promise to deal with the dragon and restore their home. If successful, they would vacate the mine as well.
