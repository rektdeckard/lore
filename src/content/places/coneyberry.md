# Coneyberry

An abandoned hamlet southeast of the **Neverwinter Wood**, Coneyberry was once the site of a religious shrine. Though left untouched for years, the shrine has recently been overrun by a band of orcs with a blue handprint on their faces. **Harbin Wester** would like the orcs dealt with.

Also sighted in the area is the blue dragon **Ieva**, who has displaced a band of intelligent were-rats from their once home in the countryside. The rats invaded **Mountain Toe Mine** when driven from their home, but agreed to return it to its rightful owner, **Don Jon Raskin**, if we can deal with the dragon.
