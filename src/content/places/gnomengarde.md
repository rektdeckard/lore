# Gnomengarde

A secretive gnomish city hidden in the Sword Mountains, led by two kings, **King Nerkle** and **King Korboz**. The city fell into chaos when a pair of mimics infiltrated and began eating people. **Korboz** became paranoid, locking his partner and himself in their room and putting the city's guards on high alert. The city's artificers **Fibblestibb** and **Dabbledobb** possess uncanny abilities for creating arcane contaptions.

After dealing with their mimic problem, the kings gift us a magical crossbow that might help us defend **Phandalin** from **Ieva** the blue dragon.
