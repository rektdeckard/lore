# Lady Alagandar

A folk hero in the northwest Sword Coast, Lady Alagandar was a knight who died over a century ago killing the evil black dragon **Ebondeath**. Her remains, along with the magical sword used to kill it, were rumored to lie in a tomb know as the **Dragon Barrow** somewhere west of the **Neverwinter Wood**.

After discovering the exact location of the tomb, we explored it and found her corpse in a sarcophagus next to the dragon's skull.
