# Myrkul

God of Death and Decay, Myrkul is strongly associated with evil. He is worshipped by necromancers and cultists, and rarely without sinister intent. His symbol is a skull inside a triangle.

While exploring the **Dragon Barrow**, we found his symbol, and evidence that he or his followers had been there before us.
