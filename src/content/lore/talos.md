# Talos

God of Storms and Destruction, often regarded as evil. He maintains a following among certain orcish tribes and often walks among them in one of his many aspects as **Grumsch**.

Lately, his influence in the **Sword Coast** has grown, and has emboldened a tribe of orcs with the mark of a _Blue Hand_ on their faces to wreak havoc in the region.
