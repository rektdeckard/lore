On the way up to the lighthouse, we alert the Harpies by accident. After a surprisingly tough fight in which both Helmut and Ekemon are enraptured by their siren song, we are able to defeat them and enter the Lighthouse.

In the Southeast room frescoes cover the walls, depicting ships dashed on rocks, below an angry god. The metal lightning rod we saw outside travels through the ceiling into a stone altar carved with lightning bolts. Helmut finds a Potion of Water Breathing. Chet grabs the lightning rod and is imbued with the power of lightning, but when Helmut tries, the power is used up. In the room to the north is the stairway leading up to the light, and a terrified orc in leather armor, holding the conch. His face has the same blue hand seared into his face. An evil grin cracks. His heart has been carved out, and he places the conch into it and draws his great axe. He then casts lightning bolt on all of us.

## Fight with Moesko

The orc, who told us his name is **Moesko**, is a tricky fucker, teleporting outside and smashing the wall down before calling a tempest on us. Roman goes down, and Chet calls lightning right back at him. We defeat him, and his body turns to ash, leaving only the conch behind. We run up to the roof, and destroy the glowing green heart at the center of the light. One final strike of lightning hits the rod, and the clouds above dissipate. Roman touches the rod and takes its last charge of lightning.

## Doing the Right Thing

Down on the beach, **Mirril** almost flips the fuck out when we tell her to wait for the conch. She begins to change into something sinister, and we have a quick chat and decide to give it to her after all. Finally at peace, she dissolves into the air, taking the conch with her. We tell **Giant Crab** and he immediately scurries into the water. Comes back with a crate filled with valuables he recovered from the shipwrecks:

- A +1 Battle Axe (1d8 / 1d10) that is lighter than expected, with ornate metal engravings of dwarven faces, with ruby. "Speed our Hammers, guide out axes.. In the name of Moradin Great Hammer..." is carved in the hilt.
- An unlocked chest containing a 9" Blue Quarts statuette of a mermaid
- A locked chest
- A black cloak with gold trim, which provides advantage on stealth checks

We take our treasure, along with a counterfeit conch shell, and head to the goblins.
