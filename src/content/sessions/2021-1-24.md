We head to the goblin hideout without the conch, knowing full well that we may have to fight to save **Bunston**'s life. Outside the cave is a lone guard wolf, and Chet sneaks past is to do some reconaissance. In the first room, he sees Bunston chained up among five chained wolves. A small passage leads up to **Clarg**'s chambers. He signals to the rest of us to follow, and we trick the guard wolf with a piece of meat and enter the cave. Chet remains hidden in the shadows, casting Minor Illusion on a normal, nonmagical conch shell to make it appear genuine, and giving it to Roman.

## Liberaci√≥n

After annoucing ourselves, we are taken to **Clarg**. He demands the conch, we try to renegotiate for the life of the human captive as well, but he's not having it. He sends his lasher guards to take it from us, and we open up a can of whoopass on them. Meanwhile, Chet tries and fails to free **Bunston** from his bonds, and several wolves, alerted by the action above, break their chanins and attack him. We make quick work of two of the lashers, and Roman obliterates **Clarg** with one of his lightning bolts. Grenache and Helmut hop through the passage to help Chet with the wolves, while the remaining hobgoblins surrender. 

We tell them **Bunston** is going to be their leader from now on, and they agree. But when we get down there, he wants none of it. He agrees to join our adventuring party. The human prisoner is freed, and we apply some healing magic to revive him. His name is **Sildar Halwinter**, and he was on his way to **Phandalin** at the request of **Halia** to bring his magical prowess to aid in their plight. He uses a whistle to summon six horses, and we ride for town.

## Reunited and it feels so good

Back in **Phandalin**, we take **Sildar** to the Miner's Exchange. **Halia** is overjoyed to see him, and gives him a big 'ol smooch, the two are apprently lovers. She thanks us profusely, and we leave them to tend to Sildar's wounds. In the Stonehill Inn, **Don Jon Raskin**, our biggest fan, buys us a few rounds and tells us the legend of a dragon tomb and a sword: **Lady Alegandar**, an almost mythical figure in the area's history, was a noble warrior. When the Sword Coast was threatened by the evil black dragon **Ebondeath**, she responded to the call an slayed it, died in combat with the final blow. Their remains lie entombed in a hidden tomb known as the **Dragon Barrow**. The sword that killed the dragon is rumored to have powers beyond normal weapons. He gives us the location, and we resolve to find it.
