In the storehouse of the logging camp Chet attacks the Ankeg, a monstrous centipede, and tries to hide in a room off the hallway. A terrrified creature inside screams and the door is barricaded. It fires an acid attack at the rest of the party, but we manage to weaken and kill it.

After the fight, we find **Tibor Wester** hiding in the spare room. He says the orcs attacked the camp, bringing the centipedes with them. They were led by the same orc champion with lightning in his eyes. We decide to take Tibor back to **Phandalin** to fulfil our charge. Before we go though, we check out the ruined cabin in the camp where Honor senses the source of evil.

In the cabin, under the rubble, is a collection of 13 small stick effigies of people, dipped in blood and inscribed with lightning bolt symbols. They are totems designed to bring ill-fortune to those near them. Honor sprinkles them with holy water, they sizzle and burst into flame. We hear a low rumble that slowly receds into the distance, as we sense that the evil leaves this place.

## Returning the Poopy Pants

On the trip back, **Tibor** bores us with useluess facts about accounting and the logging business. He majorly sucks. Chet scares him into pooping him with his pants, and we press through to the edge of the forest to make camp. Ekemon steals Tibor's pants while he's cleaning them, but Grenache give him his spare set. We sleep under the stars.

During Roman's watch, the same goblin approaches us. His name is **Bunston Jehricho**. After failing his bounty on us, he returns to his village in the **Neverwinter Woods** to find his family slaughtered. This was the work of the same orcs that put out the bounty, and that we encountered. He beseeches us to speak to his village's leader to commit some of their goblin lashers to aid in dealing with the orcs. Roman agrees to meet them here in two days time.

We return **Tibor** to **Phandalin** and receive our 150 gp reward, getting directions to both the mine where the missing miners were last seen, and the Shrine near **Coneyberry** where the orcs have been reported. After a full night's sleep, we head to the mines to hopefully deal with it before we meet with **Bunston**.

## Mountain Toe Mine

On the path to the mines, we come across the burned bodies of 2 dwarven miners, geometric patterns covering them. Trees are split, and the disemboweled body of a third is wrapped around them. A were-rat corpse, similarly charred, lies further down the path. This happened a few days ago at the most. Eventually we come to a cliff face with a hidden tunnel between some bushes. A sign with _Mountain Toe_ hangs above it, and a wounded old man rests beside it, **Don Jon Raskin**, the owner of the mine. He says the were-rats have attacked, and some miners are still trapped within. The rats are protected by some magic.

Ekemon sends his familiar into the tunnel, and he cries out and is silenced immediately. We enter to find a room strewn with papers and objects. Two female were-rats stand guard at the two other doorways. Honor tosset Chet a wand, and he intimidates them into taking us to see the Overseer. They take us into a larger room with 6 other were-rats, one of which is adorned in finer clothes. Two additional massive rats flank them just outside the room.

We negotiate the release of the dwarves in exchange for killing the dragon, **Ieva**, who has taken their home. If we succeed, they will also return the mine to **Raskin**. It turns out their home was near the Shrine as well.

## Wrapping Up Affairs

With the 5 dwarves and Raskin in tow, we make the march back to **Phandalin**. We head directly to the miner's guild. The reunited wives are extatic. The others heartbroken. **Halia**, sorrowful, thanks us for returning them.

Back at the **Stonehill Inn**, they've spruced up the place a bit, but the mood is still pessimistic. We have some drinks and get an early sleep for our mission tomorrow to meet **Bunston** and the other goblins.
