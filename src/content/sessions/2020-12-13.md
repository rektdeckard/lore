Back in **Phandalin**, spirits are considerably lower than usual. They've heard of our orc adventure and think it doesn't bode well for the town. There's another job posting regarding a band of orcs seen around a shrine in the area. We reluctantly decide to visit **Harbin** to get our reward and find out more. He gives us our 50 gold. Find out there is a shrine south of a town called Coneyberry 50-60 miles to the east that has been overrun by orcs.

At Barthen's provisions, Honor purchases some holy water and we get out bag of assorted gems appraised at 10 gp each, totaling 150 gp. We sell 5 and keep the other 10 gems. Chet's dagger necklace is clearly the object of interest, and **Elmar** says there is a group of collectors in **Neverwinter** who will pay well for relics of **Abathar** and the **Durogar**.

## The Dragon

We depart for **Gnomengarde**, and an hour into a trip, we are overtaken by a young Blue Dragon. After unintentionally insulting it with bribes and comparisons to Tieflings, it decides it's not fucking around and engages us. It's armor is thick, and this fight is a serious slugfest. Roman gets thrown and bitten on the stomach. The dragon decided it ain't worth it, and she says "Halia warned me you wouldn't be a fair fight" and flies away. What the fuck??

## Gnomengarde

Within 2 or 3 hours we reach the foothills of a mountain, and follow a stream to a waterfall with cave openings behind the water. There are 5 of them, three behind it and one on either side of the stream. We take the ramp up to the first and find a network of tunnels. We discover a kitchen where gnomes are making various foods and provisions out of colorful mushrooms. Chet introduces us, and they are nervious about something and say we should talk to the king. And to watch out for **Factor**. He's been a bit off these days.

In the central room, a gnome mounted inside a giant ride-on crossbow fires a bolt above our heads. Honor tackles him and Chet explains we mean no harm. He's terrified but point us toward the king. Another pair of guards stop us. Apparently there is a shapeshifter threatening the area and nobody can enter, by order of the king. Roman deceives them into thinking they are there expressly to deal with the shapeshifter, and we ascend a series of bridges into a gnome workshop.

## Mimic Mayhem

Gnomes are working on gadgets and machinery, two **Fibblestibb** and **Dabbledobb** are arguing between making a _Sanity Ray_ and a _Straight Jacket_. **King Nerkle** has been locked up by **King Korboz**. He's saying they're not coming out until someone deals with the shape changer. Korboz said 2 gnomes were eather by something. Nobody knows if it's true. These devices are supposed to help fix Korboz.

Korboz saw a chair eat two gnomes. We learn it is a mimic, and though it was last seen on the far side of the river. We comb thru rooms until the wine storage room. Ekemon summons his cat familiar to test the objects, and on our first try the cat is chomped by two mimics disguised as barrels, and torn in half.

We fight. Roman's hand gets trapped in one. Grenache lands the killing blow.

**Fibblestibb** and **Dabbledobb** give us two items in appreciation: a Clockwork Amulet, and a Pole of Collapsing. The **Nerkle** and **Korboz** express their gratitude as well, giving us the Wand of Pyrotechnics and the Hat of Wizardry. They agree to trade us the magical crossbow that **Factor** was manning earlier in exchange for

Ulu and me flirt, he's not ready for anything serious, but we exchange speaking stone numbers.
