# 2021.1.9

In the morning, we know we have an appointment to keep. Ekemon and Chet stop by **Barthen's Provisions** to resupply, and **Elmar** is not pleased. But they apologize. His other employee, a human boy named **Ander Wagon**, is wary. Ekemon manages to fuck it up once again and gets banned. We leave to go meet **Bunston Jericho**.

Meeting him at the edge of the wood, he says we should get a move on (he's not happy about our late start) as we're still a day away. Along the overgrown trail we decide to hunt a deer to bring to the Chieftain as a gesture of good faith. Grenache flies into a rage and scares most of them off, but manages to get one.

We make camp and cook up some of the organ meat before going to sleep. Chet is awakened in the night by a noise, and discovers that a pair of knolls have found our camp and are preparing to attack. One is armed and one is not. Chet surprise attacks and we brawl it out. Roman gets a nasty bite. After defeating them, we get back to sleep.

After the rest of a nights sleep, **Bunston** is eager to head out and ushers us along the trail. After a few hours, we turn off the main path by a bush with red berries, and follow it to a cave guarded by wolves. **Bunston** signals them, and they stand down as we are allowed to enter.

## The Goblin Hideout

Following the tunnel past a room with the sound of growling and chains to a large cavern, we see a bridge with a pair of goblins, a large staircase along the western wall, and a narrow ramp to the bridge on the eastern. The goblins are NOT very friendly, but we are taken through to meet the Lashers to make our case. In the room above, a number of Lashers and lesser goblins are milling about. A human captive in bad shape is tied up on the floor. Ekemon removes his human diguise, getting the Lashers' attention immediately. They take us directly to **Clarg**, the Chieftain.

The chamber is filled with stolen provisions, to the west is an opening into a dark chasm with the same bestial sounds as before. A fire burns in the center. **Clarg**, a massive hobgoblin, stands flanked by chainmail-clad guards. He doesn't really want to work with us, but offers an exchange. West of the Tribor trail, along the coast, there is a lighthouse with an enchanted shell inside. They seek it. If we recover it, they promise their clan's help in dealing with the orcs. **Bunston** will be punished for bringing us there, but he will be kept alive. We agree to the terms.

## Lighthouse Heist

We hop on the wagon of a logger guy and catch a ride to the shore. We near the steep cliffs that border the ocean, and below lies the lighthouse. The tower sits on a rocky peninsula on the sea. The light atop it pulses with green energy, and a heartbeat sounds with every pulse. Four wrecked ships surround the cliffs, and bolts of lightning periodically strike the tower. We descend the steep stairs.

A giant crab pops out of nowhere speaking common. He had a master named **Mirril**, a powerful wizard who imbued him with the power to talk. She's been dead for a while, but her spirit was trapped here haunting the lighthouse. A flock of evil harpies help guard the tower, and dangerous sharks led by a queen shark named **Daggermouth** guard the waters around it.

Crossing the narrow stone bridge to the island where the tower lies, we see a cave a the base of it, and a ghostly elf banshee sits inside. Her spectral garments flow as if underwater. It is the ghost of the wizard **Mirril**. She is trapped here until someone helps retrieve her conch shell, without it she cannot pass on from this world. Roman "promises" they will get the conch. Ekemon wargs into his owl, and sees that in the lamp at the top of the tower is a glowing green human-sized heart.
