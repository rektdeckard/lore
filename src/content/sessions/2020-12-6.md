## Trouble of Leadership

We wake and eat breakfast. Halia Thornton, of the mining guild, is grateful for us saving Adabra. Honor asks about how to find out about his own lineage. She suggests Neverwinter.She congratulates us on our victory over the manticore. She tells us Gnomengarde is past Umbridge Hill, to the southeast, nestled between two mountains. She thinks she could do the job better than Harbin. Chet receives a secret message from her in thieves' cant, offering 150GP for the Gnomish weapon if we give it to her instead of Harbin.

We decide to first warn the dwarves before continuing to Gnomengarde. Honor picks up a bedroll. Elmar Barthen doesn't have much nice to say about Harbin either. He manages money well, but can't be trusted to defend the town. Thinks that the kid in the shop, Thistle Bottle, would pick up a sword first.

## Excavation Site

We take the road west toward the dwarven excavation site. A the end of a deep canyon is a large, decayed black stone gate. We see a ruined settlement ahead. Grenache recognizes the stonework as that of the Durogar, some bad dwarf mofos who were obsessed with treasure. Inside the settlement is an entrance cut into the mountain, flanked by 10-foot cloaked dwarf statue.

We bring the warning about the dragon, but it turns out these dwarves have a problem of their own. **Norbis** and **Dazzlin** encountered some kind of jelly inside. They will give us 2 sending stones to deal with it. Grenache recognizes one of the statues as Abathar, the dwarven god of greed. This is a temple to him.

Inside the temple is a hallway leading to a large chamber with 4 columns. There is a secret door to the right. Down the secret passage are dead-end walls marked with dwarven faces. I inspect the northern wall, and find that the dwarf's eyes are buttons. Pushing them opens the wall into the main chamber. Two emeralds fall from the ceiling.

The vaulted ceiling is over 30 feet high here. At the center of the chamber is a dais. The jelly oozes out of a crack in the column. It turns out that slashing damage can split them and cause them to multiply. During the fight, Ekemon and Roman are knocked unconscious by acid jelly punches. Roman gets dick punched and cured by Honor. They defeat the slimes.

We explore hidden secret chambers and find a bag of emeralds below the dais and a necklace with a dagger and the slogan "Greed is Good". Chet gets his hands blown up by trying to steal a giant ruby from a statue of Abathar. We decide to get our reward and leave, and run into a band of Orcs on the way out. They have handprints in blue dye on their faces. After a heated battle in which Chet tries some new spin moves and Ekemon blasts a hole through a mofo, we defeat them and look thru agree to escort **Norbis** and **Dazzlin** back to **Phandalin**.
