**Halia** gives us **Sildar**'s whistle and thanks us for saving his life. He's too weak to talk to, but we should return in several days. We have a good old-fashioned campfire. We decide to pursure the **Dragon Sword** in the morning. We wake up, and **Bunston** is gone and his tracks lead northwest, the same direction as the **Dragon Barrow**. We pursue, knowing that he may be experiencing PTSD from his experiences. After 6 hours of riding we see a large flat-topped hill surrounded by tall white marker stones. A centaur, **Xanth**, warns us of hauntings in the area, **Lady Alegandar** does not sleep peacefully. At night, _Witch Lights_ float in the air here, the spirits of the dead that have not moved on.

## The Dragon Barrow

At the top of the hill, we see that it is in the massive shape of a dragon, with the rocks marking out its spine. The last stone in the tail is laying on its side. A spiral staircase leads down the hole. Chet investivates, and a small witch light circles the hole, then descends... **Bunston** appears, terrified, and we tell him to wait. The witch lights float around a pile of horse bones, which assemble into a living skeletal horse. We feed it a berry. Down the hall we reach an intersection. The east path smells of death. We go west and Grenache falls into a pit. Three wisps attack, and they're tough but we pop them. The sepulchur at the end of the hall has four sarcophagi, marked with a Lute, Sun, Sword, Staff. We play music and hear a moan from down the hall, but see nothing. We open the sword tomb, and there is the moldy remains of a soldier, buried with honor.

We explore the path to the east, where the smell is coming from. In the room are two sarcophagi, two skeletons, two zombies, and an ogre zombie. One of the sarcophagi is open, and a noxious gas is emanating from it. Roman lightning bolts them, instantly killing the little guys. We wail on the ogre and explode his guts. Roman pukes on himself. Chet notices that the sarcophagus contains two springs and a broken glass vial. They were part of a trap that was triggered when the tomb was opened. The zombies are all branded on the forehead with a triangle with a skull in the center. We recall the god **Myrkul**, god of death, uses this symbol. Someone sent these things here.

Down the north passage, we see two more sarcophagi marked with some sort of royal crest. In the center of the room it the massive skull of the dragon, a sword with a black hilt inlaid with gold plunged into it. Helmut pulls the sword, and the spectral spirit of a dragon emerges from it, passing through the ceiling above us. It flies off, seemingly at peace. We approach the horses, and **Xanth** is mortified. Apparently we released **Ebondeath** from his prison, and if he finds a body, will regain his powers. We loot the remaining tombs for a beautiful beaded neckalace with fire in the gemstones, and a magical lute.

## To the Shrine

We set off post-haste toward **Coneyberry** and the orcs. The town itself is nothing but ruins, over a century old. There we turn south toward the shrine. Then sun behins to set as we come upon an old stone temple with a belltower, half crumbled but still standing. The western wing is collapsed. A crumbling wall surrounds the land, with gatehouses on each side, and towers at each corner once stood.
