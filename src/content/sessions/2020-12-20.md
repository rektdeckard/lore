We leave **Gnomengarde** with the Crossbow in tow, with 10 bolts in large and small sizes. It can magically change in size and is pulled by a giant mechanicial mastiff to deliver it to **Phandalin**.

A storm picks up as we head back along the muddy road. We encounter a goblin with a wanted poster with Ekemon's face on it. He says realizes he's no match for us and wants no trouble. The bounty was put out on him by the blue-faced orcs. We give him 2 GP for his silence and continue on cautiously. Ekemon uses his disguise kit.

Back in town, three dwarven women outside the miner's guild look like they've been crying. There are some new quests on the job board:

> Many of the miners' wives live in **Phandalin** while their husbands work in the mines during the week. The miners have not returned and they are several days late. 100gp to anyone who can find out what happened and hopefully bring the miners home safe.

> I haven't heard from my brother, **Tibor**, in a week. He runs a logging camp on the south shore of the river east from Neverwinter. You will find his camp about 15 miles into the forest. Please, go make sure he's alright. I will give you 150 gold pieces if you can find out what's happened to him.

**Halia** approaches us and discovers we have the weapon. She reveals that **Ieva** is manipulative, and that she is not in fact working with her. Her interests are in the town's safety, and though her organization has had dealings with the dragon in the past, she only wants what's good for **Phandalin**. We make the exchange.

We pay a visit to **Harbin**, who is...somehwat disappointed about the crossbow. But we offer him the Hat of Wizardry instead, and he accepts. We promise him we will look in on his brother's logging camp in the **Neverwinter Wood**, at least a day's journey away. Before we go, Ekemon and Chet stop by **Barthen's Provisions** for rations. Chet acts like a pedo and pat's Thistle Bottle's bum, Ekemon tries to stop him and they both embarass themselves.

Deciding to take the direct path through the **Neverwinter Wood**, we head off toward the logging camp. We stop for the evening at the edge of the woods. We are awakened by a pack of wild boars encircling us. We engage, Chet killing one, before the main boar, much larger than the rest, bellows as his eyes flash with lightning. The rest of the boars are scared off.

After a bruising battle, Roman deals a Flurry of Blows that sunders the boar. The beast transforms into a half-orc male with a blue handprint burned into his face. There is a hole in his chest where his heart once was.

> "You're too late. This land will fall to the will of Talos. He cannot be stopped, and I cannot be killed."

He slits his own throat and black blood oozes out. He laughes as his body crumbles into dust and blows away. Honor recognizes **Talos** as the evil god of storms and destruction. This man was most likely an aspect of an orcish god, **Grumsch**, and a devotee of Talos. Exhausted, we set the dead boar on a spit and smoke the meat while we rest up.

In the morning, we continue on to the logging camp. Some tents and cabins dot the shore and surrounding hill, and a grim silence fills the camp. Helmet's Divine Sense detects a fiendish sense from a ruined cabin, and some of the tents have been damaged by acid. Humanoid footprints cover the ground, but none of them leave the area. A suspicious hole looks like the source of the creature responsible.

Chet approaches the intact cabin and knocks on the door. It creaks open and we see it is filled haphazardly with logging equipment. As Chet crosses the room, a hole opens in the floor and a massive, six-legged insectoid emerges, clicking its mandibles at us...
