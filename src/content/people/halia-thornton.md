# Halia Thornton

Leader of the Mining Guild in **Phandalin**, Halia has aspirations to run the city as well. She is unhappy with the job that **Harbin Wester** is doing, despite the positive economic impact he has had on the town. She may have plans to forcfully take over if things don't get better.

Halia secretly offered to pay us triple the offered rate (150 gp) for any magical weapon we can bring back from **Gnomengarde**, if it will help defend against the dragon.
