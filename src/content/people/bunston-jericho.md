# Bunston Jericho

A common goblin from the **Neverwinter Wood**, Bunston took a bounty on our heads offered by a tribe of Blue Face orcs. We encountered him on the path between **Gnomengarde** and **Phandalin**, and 'convinced' him to walk away when he tried to make good on it.

We later encountered him at the edge of the wood. He had discovered on returning to his village that many of his kith and kin had been slaughtered by the orcs for turning down the bounty. He sought our help in convincing his leader to mount an offensive against the orcs to seek justice for the dead. We agreed to meet him in two days time at the same place to see if we could aid in persuading them.
