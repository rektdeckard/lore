# Bunston Jericho

A common goblin from the **Neverwinter Wood**, Bunston took a bounty on our heads offered by a tribe of Blue Face orcs. We encountered him on the path between **Gnomengarde** and **Phandalin**, and 'convinced' him to walk away when he tried to make good on it.

We later encountered him at the edge of the wood. He had discovered on returning to his village that many of his family had been slaughtered by the orcs for turning down the bounty. He sought our help in convincing his leader to mount an offensive against the orcs to seek justice for the dead. We agreed to meet him in two days time at the same place to see if we could aid in persuading them.

His move was not taken well by his leader **Clarg**, and he was imprisoned. We agreed to recover a magical conch shell for the chieftain in exchange for Bunston's life, but later decided he could not be trusted with something so powerful. So we murdered Clarg and offered Bunston the big chair. He instead decided he would rather join our adventuring party.
