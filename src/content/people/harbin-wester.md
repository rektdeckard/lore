# Harbin Wester

The Townmaster of **Phandalin**, Harbin is a cowardly man who has nevertheless seen the town through great economic growth. Though a poor leader, he still cares for the safety of the town and has financed a number of missions to protect it.

Harbin's brother **Tibor Wester** ran a logging camp on the shores of the **Neverwinter River**, which was overrun by the blue-faced orcs.
