# Tibor Wester

Owner of a logging camp in the **Neverwinter Wood** and brother to **Phandalin** townmaster **Harbin Wester**, Tibor is no less craven and self-absorbed than his kin. When his camp was attacked by the Blue Face orcs, Tibor hid in the storeroom while his employees were slaughtered. We rescued him and returned him to his brother, but not before he pooped his little poppy pants in fear.
