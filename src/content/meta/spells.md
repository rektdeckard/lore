# Spells

[PHB 208](https://thetrove.is/Books/Dungeons%20%26%20Dragons%20%5Bmulti%5D/5th%20Edition%20%285e%29/Core/Player%27s%20Handbook%20%5B10th%20Print%5D.pdf#page=208)

If you have some spells, I'd recommend taking a screenshot of the spells you have and storing them away. I'm going to do that too - that way I have a quick reference for all of the spells we'll be seeing in the game and how they work.

For anyone who might cast magic, this might be handy: [Spell Cards](http://hardcodex.ru/)

The PHB has all of the spells sorted alphabetically, which makes it hard for any given class to see all of their spells in one place. This page lets you do that.
